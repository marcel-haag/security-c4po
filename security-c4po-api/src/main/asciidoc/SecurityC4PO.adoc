This documentation describes the REST API for the "SecurityC4PO".

The service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs and status codes.

== Error handling

You can generally expect 4xx for client errors and 5xx for server errors.

== Request Headers

The request and response snippets shown in this documentation are generated from real interactions.
When creating requests you must not follow the examples exactly, e.g. instead of providing the Accept Header `application/json, application/javascript, text/javascript` you can also provide only one value, typically `application/json`.
