    "description": "In the frontend the popular Angular framework is used to create a so-called Single Page Application.\nJavaScript is also used in the backend as the exclusive programming language: An Express application hosted in a Node.js server delivers the client-side code to the browser. It also provides the necessary backend functionality to the client via a RESTful API.\nAs an underlying database a light-weight SQLite was chosen, because of its file-based nature. Sequelize and finale-rest are used as an abstraction layer from the database.\nAs an additional data store, a MarsDB is part of the OWASP Juice Shop.\nThe application also offers user registration via OAuth 2.0 so users can sign in with their Google accounts.",
