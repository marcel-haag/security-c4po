# Security C4PO Angular

This Angular application serves as the frontend interface for Security C4PO, allowing users to efficiently manage and generate comprehensive reports for their penetration testing activities.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
