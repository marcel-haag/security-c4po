# Appendencies

title.findings_severities=Findings Severities
text.findings_severities=Each finding has been assigned a severity rating of critical high, medium, or low. The rating is based off of an assessment of the priority with which each finding should be viewed and the potential impact each has on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
title.risk_matrix=Risk Matrix
text.risk_matrix=The risk matrix is used to assess the potential damage of a hazard, based on the likelihood and severity factors. The likelihood and severity scores are multiplied to obtain a score value. This score is looked up in the risk ranges to determine the risk level. An example of a hazard risk matrix is given below:
example.risk_matrix=Example, if Likelihood = Possible (3) and Severity = Major (4), the risk level is determined by severity * likelihood, which is 3*4 = 12. The score 12 falls in 'High' risk range.

title.severity_definitions=Severity Rating Definitions
text.severity_definitions.critical=Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will cause substantial harm. Significant political, financial, and/or legal damage is likely to result. The threat exposure is critical, and a publicly available mechanism exists to exploit the vulnerability. Security controls are not effectively implemented to reduce the severity of impact if the vulnerability were exploited.
text.severity_definitions.high=Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will cause substantial harm. Significant political, financial, and/or legal damage is likely to result. The threat exposure is high, thereby increasing the likelihood of occurrence. Security controls are not effectively implemented to reduce the severity of impact if the vulnerability were exploited.
text.severity_definitions.medium=Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will significantly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of the system, application, or data. Exploitation of the vulnerability may cause moderate financial loss or public embarrassment. The threat exposure is moderate-to-high, thereby increasing the likelihood of occurrence. Security controls are in place to contain the severity of impact if the vulnerability were exploited, such that further political, financial, or legal damage will not occur. - OR - The vulnerability is such that it would otherwise be considered High Risk, but the threat exposure is so limited that the likelihood of occurrence is minimal.
text.severity_definitions.low=Exploitation of the technical or procedural vulnerability will cause minimal impact to operations. The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of sensitive information are not at risk of compromise. Exploitation of the vulnerability may cause slight financial loss or public embarrassment. The threat exposure is moderate-to-low. Security controls are in place to contain the severity of impact if the vulnerability were exploited, such that further political, financial, or legal damage will not occur. - OR - The vulnerability is such that it would otherwise be considered Medium Risk, but the threat exposure is so limited that the likelihood of occurrence is minimal.
